![Saga Pattern Flow](saga-pattern-flow.png)

Below is a visual representation of the Saga Pattern flow implemented in this codebase:

```
+-------------------+
|   Order Created   |
+-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
| Payment Requested |
+-------------------+
          |
   +------+------+
   |             |
   v             v
Payment      Payment
Success      Failure
   |             |
   v             v
+-------------------+   +-------------------+
| Shipping Started  |   | Compensation Step |
+-------------------+   +-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
| Saga Completed    |
+-------------------+
```

- Each step is coordinated via Azure Service Bus queues.
- Compensation logic is triggered on payment failure.
- Saga state is persisted in the database.
- Handlers and commands manage transitions between steps.

> See `OrderCommands`, `PaymentCommands`, `ShippingCommands`, and their handlers for implementation details.
